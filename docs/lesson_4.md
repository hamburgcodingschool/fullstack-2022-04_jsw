# Lesson 4

We've recapped a lot of stuff in this lesson, so I don't have a lot to say.

## What we've used

- (just showed it briefly. We're going to cover everything `Array.prototype.*` in another lesson) [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
- [Element.dataset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset)
