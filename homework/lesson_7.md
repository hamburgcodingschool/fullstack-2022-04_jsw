# Homework Lesson 7

## 1. Simply continue with the pokemon excercise.

Add as much data as you want to the detail view. One fun way would be to do what Vassilis did with our addressbook and instead of trying to display all the details in a structured way, maybe try to do a textual description of the pokemon that contains the data. Try to solve that with the `h()` function instead of innerHTML. (Look at [lesson6/address_book.html](../code/lesson6/address_book.html) for an example).

Feel free to continue in the same groups if you can get it organised or as individuals. In any case, try to keep in touch if you can and exchange ideas.

## Display more pokemon (optional)

Add a "show more pokemon" button at the bottom of the list (but not "in" the list) that loads additional pokemon using the "next" link from the /pokemon endpoint.

See if you can restructure the code in a way that you can reuse the code from the initial render of the list.

Update the button so that it works a second time to load the third group of pokemons.
