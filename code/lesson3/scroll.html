    <p>
      Once there was a boy. He was--let us say--something like fourteen years
      old; long and loose-jointed and towheaded. He wasn&#39;t good for much,
      that boy. His chief delight was to eat and sleep; and after that--he liked
      best to make mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Sunday morning and the boy&#39;s parents were getting ready to go
      to church. The boy sat on the edge of the table, in his shirt sleeves, and
      thought how lucky it was that both father and mother were going away, and
      the coast would be clear for a couple of hours. &quot;Good! Now I can take
      down pop&#39;s gun and fire off a shot, without anybody&#39;s meddling
      interference,&quot; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was almost as if father should have guessed the boy&#39;s thoughts,
      for just as he was on the threshold--ready to start--he stopped short, and
      turned toward the boy. &quot;Since you won&#39;t come to church with
      mother and me,&quot; he said, &quot;the least you can do, is to read the
      service at home. Will you promise to do so?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said
      the boy, &quot;that I can do easy enough.&quot; And he thought, of course,
      that he wouldn&#39;t read any more than he felt like reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy thought that never had he seen his mother so persistent. In a
      second she was over by the shelf near the fireplace, and took down
      Luther&#39;s Commentary and laid it on the table, in front of the
      window--opened at the service for the day. She also opened the New
      Testament, and placed it beside the Commentary. Finally, she drew up the
      big arm-chair, which was bought at the parish auction the year before, and
      which, as a rule, no one but father was permitted to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy sat thinking that his mother was giving herself altogether too
      much trouble with this spread; for he had no intention of reading more
      than a page or so. But now, for the second time, it was almost as if his
      father were able to see right through him. He walked up to the boy, and
      said in a severe tone: &quot;Now, remember, that you are to read
      carefully! For when we come back, I shall question you thoroughly; and if
      you have skipped a single page, it will not go well with you.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;The service is fourteen and a half pages long,&quot; said his
      mother, just as if she wanted to heap up the measure of his misfortune.
      &quot;You&#39;ll have to sit down and begin the reading at once, if you
      expect to get through with it.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that they departed. And as the boy stood in the doorway watching
      them, he thought that he had been caught in a trap. &quot;There they go
      congratulating themselves, I suppose, in the belief that they&#39;ve hit
      upon something so good that I&#39;ll be forced to sit and hang over the
      sermon the whole time that they are away,&quot; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his father and mother were certainly not congratulating themselves
      upon anything of the sort; but, on the contrary, they were very much
      distressed. They were poor farmers, and their place was not much bigger
      than a garden-plot. When they first moved there, the place couldn&#39;t
      feed more than one pig and a pair of chickens; but they were uncommonly
      industrious and capable folk--and now they had both cows and geese. Things
      had turned out very well for them; and they would have gone to church that
      beautiful morning--satisfied and happy--if they hadn&#39;t had their son
      to think of. Father complained that he was dull and lazy; he had not cared
      to learn anything at school, and he was such an all-round
      good-for-nothing, that he could barely be made to tend geese. Mother did
      not deny that this was true; but she was most distressed because he was
      wild and bad; cruel to animals, and ill-willed toward human beings.
      &quot;May God soften his hard heart, and give him a better
      disposition!&quot; said the mother, &quot;or else he will be a misfortune,
      both to himself and to us.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stood for a long time and pondered whether he should read the
      service or not. Finally, he came to the conclusion that, this time, it was
      best to be obedient. He seated himself in the easy chair, and began to
      read. But when he had been rattling away in an undertone for a little
      while, this mumbling seemed to have a soothing effect upon him--and he
      began to nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most beautiful weather outside! It was only the twentieth of
      March; but the boy lived in West Vemmingh√∂g Township, down in Southern
      Skane, where the spring was already in full swing. It was not as yet
      green, but it was fresh and budding. There was water in all the trenches,
      and the colt&#39;s-foot on the edge of the ditch was in bloom. All the
      weeds that grew in among the stones were brown and shiny. The beech-woods
      in the distance seemed to swell and grow thicker with every second. The
      skies were high--and a clear blue. The cottage door stood ajar, and the
      lark&#39;s trill could be heard in the room. The hens and geese pattered
      about in the yard, and the cows, who felt the spring air away in their
      stalls, lowed their approval every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy read and nodded and fought against drowsiness. &quot;No! I
      don&#39;t want to fall asleep,&quot; thought he, &quot;for then I&#39;ll
      not get through with this thing the whole forenoon.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>But--somehow--he fell asleep.</p>
    <p>
      He did not know whether he had slept a short while, or a long while; but
      he was awakened by hearing a slight noise back of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the window-sill, facing the boy, stood a small looking-glass; and
      almost the entire cottage could be seen in this. As the boy raised his
      head, he happened to look in the glass; and then he saw that the cover to
      his mother&#39;s chest had been opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother owned a great, heavy, iron-bound oak chest, which she permitted
      no one but herself to open. Here she treasured all the things she had
      inherited from her mother, and of these she was especially careful. Here
      lay a couple of old-time peasant dresses, of red homespun cloth, with
      short bodice and plaited shirt, and a pearl-bedecked breast pin. There
      were starched white-linen head-dresses, and heavy silver ornaments and
      chains. Folks don&#39;t care to go about dressed like that in these days,
      and several times his mother had thought of getting rid of the old things;
      but somehow, she hadn&#39;t had the heart to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the boy saw distinctly--in the glass--that the chest-lid was open. He
      could not understand how this had happened, for his mother had closed the
      chest before she went away. She never would have left that precious chest
      open when he was at home, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became low-spirited and apprehensive. He was afraid that a thief had
      sneaked his way into the cottage. He didn&#39;t dare to move; but sat
      still and stared into the looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he sat there and waited for the thief to make his appearance, he
      began to wonder what that dark shadow was which fell across the edge of
      the chest. He looked and looked--and did not want to believe his eyes. But
      the thing, which at first seemed shadowy, became more and more clear to
      him; and soon he saw that it was something real. It was no less a thing
      than an elf who sat there--astride the edge of the chest!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, the boy had heard stories about elves, but he had never
      dreamed that they were such tiny creatures. He was no taller than a
      hand&#39;s breadth--this one, who sat on the edge of the chest. He had an
      old, wrinkled and beardless face, and was dressed in a black frock coat,
      knee-breeches and a broad-brimmed black hat. He was very trim and smart,
      with his white laces about the throat and wrist-bands, his buckled shoes,
      and the bows on his garters. He had taken from the chest an embroidered
      piece, and sat and looked at the old-fashioned handiwork with such an air
      of veneration, that he did not observe the boy had awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was somewhat surprised to see the elf, but, on the other hand, he
      was not particularly frightened. It was impossible to be afraid of one who
      was so little. And since the elf was so absorbed in his own thoughts that
      he neither saw nor heard, the boy thought that it would be great fun to
      play a trick on him; to push him over into the chest and shut the lid on
      him, or something of that kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy was not so courageous that he dared to touch the elf with his
      hands, instead he looked around the room for something to poke him with.
      He let his gaze wander from the sofa to the leaf-table; from the
      leaf-table to the fireplace. He looked at the kettles, then at the
      coffee-urn, which stood on a shelf, near the fireplace; on the water
      bucket near the door; and on the spoons and knives and forks and saucers
      and plates, which could be seen through the half-open cupboard door. He
      looked at his father&#39;s gun, which hung on the wall, beside the
      portrait of the Danish royal family, and on the geraniums and fuchsias,
      which blossomed in the window. And last, he caught sight of an old
      butterfly-snare that hung on the window frame. He had hardly set eyes on
      that butterfly-snare, before he reached over and snatched it and jumped up
      and swung it alongside the edge of the chest. He was himself astonished at
      the luck he had. He hardly knew how he had managed it--but he had actually
      snared the elf. The poor little chap lay, head downward, in the bottom of
      the long snare, and could not free himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first moment the boy hadn&#39;t the least idea what he should do with
      his prize. He was only particular to swing the snare backward and forward;
      to prevent the elf from getting a foothold and clambering up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elf began to speak, and begged, oh! so pitifully, for his freedom. He
      had brought them good luck--these many years--he said, and deserved better
      treatment. Now, if the boy would set him free, he would give him an old
      coin, a silver spoon, and a gold penny, as big as the case on his
      father&#39;s silver watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy didn&#39;t think that this was much of an offer; but it so
      happened--that after he had gotten the elf in his power, he was afraid of
      him. He felt that he had entered into an agreement with something weird
      and uncanny; something which did not belong to his world, and he was only
      too glad to get rid of the horrid thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason he agreed at once to the bargain, and held the snare
      still, so the elf could crawl out of it. But when the elf was almost out
      of the snare, the boy happened to think that he ought to have bargained
      for large estates, and all sorts of good things. He should at least have
      made this stipulation: that the elf must conjure the sermon into his head.
      &quot;What a fool I was to let him go!&quot; thought he, and began to
      shake the snare violently, so the elf would tumble down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the instant the boy did this, he received such a stinging box on the
      ear, that he thought his head would fly in pieces. He was dashed--first
      against one wall, then against the other; he sank to the floor, and lay
      there--senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke, he was alone in the cottage. The chest-lid was down, and
      the butterfly-snare hung in its usual place by the window. If he had not
      felt how the right cheek burned, from that box on the ear, he would have
      been tempted to believe the whole thing had been a dream. &quot;At any
      rate, father and mother will be sure to insist that it was nothing
      else,&quot; thought he. &quot;They are not likely to make any allowances
      for that old sermon, on account of the elf. It&#39;s best for me to get at
      that reading again,&quot; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he walked toward the table, he noticed something remarkable. It
      couldn&#39;t be possible that the cottage had grown. But why was he
      obliged to take so many more steps than usual to get to the table? And
      what was the matter with the chair? It looked no bigger than it did a
      while ago; but now he had to step on the rung first, and then clamber up
      in order to reach the seat. It was the same thing with the table. He could
      not look over the top without climbing to the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;What in all the world is this?&quot; said the boy. &quot;I believe
      the elf has bewitched both the armchair and the table--and the whole
      cottage.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commentary lay on the table and, to all appearances, it was not
      changed; but there must have been something queer about that too, for he
      could not manage to read a single word of it, without actually standing
      right in the book itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read a couple of lines, and then he chanced to look up. With that, his
      glance fell on the looking-glass; and then he cried aloud: &quot;Look!
      There&#39;s another one!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the glass he saw plainly a little, little creature who was dressed
      in a hood and leather breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Why, that one is dressed exactly like me!&quot; said the boy, and
      clasped his hands in astonishment. But then he saw that the thing in the
      mirror did the same thing. Then he began to pull his hair and pinch his
      arms and swing round; and instantly he did the same thing after him; he,
      who was seen in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy ran around the glass several times, to see if there wasn&#39;t a
      little man hidden behind it, but he found no one there; and then he began
      to shake with terror. For now he understood that the elf had bewitched
      him, and that the creature whose image he saw in the glass--was he,
      himself.
